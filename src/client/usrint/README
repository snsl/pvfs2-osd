These codes stack up as follows:

stdio
posix
posix-pvfs
iocommon/openfile-util
libpvfs

posix also calls out to glibc for non-pvfs file systems.
user code is expected to call in a stdio, posix, and/or posix-pvfs

stdio

This is an actual implementation of stdio based on the joined file
descriptor/pointer implemented in openfile-util - this is here mostly
so calls to libc don't bypass our system calls.

posix

These are wrappers that either call the glibc or the pvfs version

posix-pvfs

These implement the system calls for pvfs using the iocommon calls

iocommon

These are based on the codes in the pvfs apps and other implementations
that access pvfs via the sysint calls

openfile-util

These are data structures used in the stdio/posix implementation.  Mostly
an open file table and method tables, various other functions and structures
needed for those implementations

libpvfs

This is the client sysint code - not in this directory
