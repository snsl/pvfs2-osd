/**
 * A PVFS_path keeps up with an path we are trying to access and the
 * the results of processing that path.  If the path is qualified and/or
 * expanded then the path starts at the root and has had all . and /
 * elements removed (except a single / between segments).  Qualified
 * paths have not had any segment verified or resolved.  Later a resolved
 * path has the pvfs_path pointer pointing to the portion of the path
 * just past the mount point and has the fs_id filled in.  In most cases
 * we co do a lookup from there.  If the path fails to resolve or lookup
 * correctly we will fully expand the path resolving symbolic links.
 * During this process each segment is resolved and then looked up to see
 * if it is a symlink, and if so the link is read and the path futher
 * expanded.  If a segment fails to look up the process stops.  In this
 * case the last successful lookup in pvfs space will have its object
 * handle recorded and the filename poitner will point to the remaining
 * segments.  In the case where we are creating an object this might be a
 * signle segment.  If it is multiple segments it may be an error.
 *
 * the structure uspassed around using the address if the expanded path
 * buffer so that it appears to be a simple char path.  Functions compute
 * the address of the structure and check for the magic number to verify
 * they have a PVFS_path and not single char array.  This is used because
 * some of the interfaces can either be called by a higher layer
 * interface that has already done some processing, or directly by a
 * program which has not.
